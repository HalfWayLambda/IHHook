IHHook changelog 
- just the changes that are most likely to be added to IH readme, otherwise just look at the github commits.

r11 IHr247 - 2021-04-05
Hooks_FOV - cribbing from https://github.com/mon/MGSV-TPP-FoV , supported by IH InfCamHook.lua

r10 IHr244 - 2021-03-31
Version jumped IHHook, still have to figure out versioning vs IH required IHHook version vs leeway to release an update of IHHook seperately.
Refactor hook macros for clarity.
Fix: menu close button working from start, doesn't require the IH callback so it can function when it's there as the startup error window.
Fix: Steam version_info.txt check to see if it's the jp language version. Currently it only warns, and does not hook, but that's better than crashing lol.

r7, IHr243 - 2021-03-29
Fix: A grame crash soon after starting - issue likely was user not having vs redist for what IHHook was built against.
Downgraded platform toolset to VS2017/v141 to hit less vsredist issues - thanks fintip for the report and working through test builds with me.

r7, IHr240 - 2021-03-26
Full* lua API hook again. (still a few pesky missing functions).
AddressCSVToMacroHeader.lua
mgstpp-adresses-1.0.15.3.csv - exported from ghidra
To generate function > address macro header, replacing my prior method of manually updating the headers for 100 functions lol.
GetFreeRoamLangIdHook - to override the free roam entry which was hard coded to locations and return empty string for custom.

r7 - 2021-03-24

F3 - togglemenu

Fix: Imgui gamepad support (which was enabled by default, but I wasn't actually using) links xinput, which caused controller - thanks MIKEH2011 for your report and testing.
Fix: SelectCombo was checking menuItems bounds instead of menuSettings, which meant combo selection wouldn't update on keyboard scroll if #combo settings > #menu items.
Fix: Return if exe is mgo (don't know if it was issue)

r6 - 2021-03-12

l_GetGamePath

r4 - 2020-01-27
IHHook inited via a thread rather than directly in dllmain, still not 'the way', but better.
After trying a few different types of input it seems like MGSV is using RawInput.
So added a basic rough out of RawInput processing and blocking.

r3 - 2020-01-22
Pipe server

r2 - 2020-01-13
Most of the lua api hooked and get a lua C module (winapi) kinda working.
