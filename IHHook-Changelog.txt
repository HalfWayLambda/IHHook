F3 - togglemenu

Fix: Imgui gamepad support (which was enabled by default, but I wasn't actually using) links xinput, which caused controller - thanks MIKEH2011 for your report and testing.
Fix: SelectCombo was checking menuItems bounds instead of menuSettings, which meant combo selection wouldn't update on keyboard scroll if #combo settings > #menu items.
Fix: Return if exe is mgo (don't know if it was issue)

IHHook inited via a thread rather than directly in dllmain, still not 'the way', but better.
After trying a few different types of input it seems like MGSV is using RawInput.
So added a basic rough out of RawInput processing and blocking.
