# Developing a new IHHook version

Work for a new version should be done on a seperate development branch than main.

Bump the Version in IHHook.h and FileVersion in Resource Files/IHHook.rc

Try and get some Modders Heaven community members to test build builds for you

Using IHHook lua functions:
Lua code can check for the global _IHHook to see if IHHook is running. It will be nil if not, or the IHHook version number if so.
Which you can also use to guard against user running versions before the IHHook functions you're using.
IH menus and Ivars can set a .requiresIHH bool to exclude themselves if IHH is not running.

Documentation:
Make sure Changelog.txt has a synopsis of major changes.
Copy the latest changelog on to the top of the ReadMe.md
As Readme.md is coppied to txt (since most users wont have the filetype associated to open it) remember to add two spaces at the end of lines you want to linebreak in .md rather than double breaking which will space out txt weird.
The readme should be directly copied into into the nexusmods description page on release.

Releases:
Make sure VS is set to release build.
Visual Studio post-build step should copy and rename the dll to the makebite folder.
It also copies ReadMe.md and Changelog.md to makebite/GameDir/mod/docs
Simply use makebite on the makebite folder.
And zip the .mgsv

Compare the .mgsv against a previous build
and test installation for good measure.

When you're sure of a release make a pull of the development branch to main.
