# Developing a new IHHook version

Work for a new version should be done on a seperate development branch than main.
Try and get some Modders Heaven community members to test build builds for you

You should edit documents (mainly Changelog and Readme) in makebite/GameDir/mod/Docs directly.

Releases:
Make sure VS is set to release build.
Visual studio post-build step should copy and rename the dll to the makebite folder.
It also copies makebite/GameDir/mod/docs/IHHook-Readme.txt to makebite/ so makebite updates its metadata.xml with it.
Simply use makebite on the makebite folder.
And zip the .mgsv

Compare the .mgsv vs a previous build
and test installation for good measure.
